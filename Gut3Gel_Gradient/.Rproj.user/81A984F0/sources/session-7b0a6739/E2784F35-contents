## Product Description

Reproducible and high-throughput *in vitro* models are essential for studying complex microbial communities. This kit is designed for the *in vitro* modeling of human colon mucus layers. **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** is presented here as a platform for culturing human microbiota samples. The protocol describes how to culture fecal samples in **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** using a multi-well plate format and how to prepare the samples for downstream analyses. Downstream assays include cell viability assessment, flow cytometry, metabolomics, and sequencing. The potential applications of **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** include microbial mining, drug screening, and permeability assays.

## Components

- 2x multi-well plates containing gradient **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** colonic.

- 50 mL Bac<sup>3</sup>Gel&reg; dissolution medium (50 mM sodium citrate).

## Reagent Required But Not Provided

- 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution prepared in deionized water.

## Storage Conditions

Store in a dry place inside tightly sealed containers at 2-8 &deg;C.

This product can be stored for at least 9 months.

## Precautions and Disclaimer

For R&D use only.

## Procedure

### Before you begin

- The protocol below describes the specific steps for using fecal samples. However, this protocol has also been used to culture monocultures, co-cultures, and microbial consortia. The **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** used in this protocol was produced in Brain Hearth Infusion (BHI) medium and is composed of 50 mg.mL<sup>-1</sup> porcine stomach type III mucin. **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel**'s composition is fully tunable; customized compositions are commercially available (i.e. incorporation of other mucin types, proteins, lipids and media). The cross-linking and oxygen gradients within **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** are intrinsic features established during the production process. These are dynamically affected by microbial culturing.

- Ensure all instruments and consumables (blender, colander, pipettes, falcons, and microcentrifuge tubes) are sterilized and free of contaminants.

- All manipulations should be performed under aseptic conditions, ideally in a Class II biological safety cabinet.

- Prepare a 0.9% (w/v) sterile NaCl solution.


### A. Fecal Sample Processing

 {{< iconify svg-spinners:clock >}} **Timing: ~ 15 min**

**1.** Weigh at least 30 g of fresh fecal sample and transfer to a sterilized blender.
  
  - For each 30 g of fecal sample, add 150 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution.

  - Homogenize the mixture until a uniform slurry is obtained.

**2.** To remove large particulate matter, filter the slurry through a sterilized colander into a sterile container.

  - Aliquot into 50 mL falcon tubes.
  
  - Keep the filtered slurry on ice until use (do not exceed 1 hour).

::: {.callout-tip}
## Optional

Filtered slurry can be aliquoted, supplemented with glycerol (final concentration of 10% v/v) and stored at -80 &deg;C for future experiments. This should be done as quickly as possible to preserve microbial diversity.

:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## CRITICAL

Fecal samples should be as fresh as possible; ideally, processing should start within 30 minutes from defecation time.

Rapid processing is crucial to maintain microbial viability.

Avoid excessive blending to prevent mechanical damage to microbes.
:::


### B. Culturing in **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** 

{{< iconify svg-spinners:clock >}} **Timing: ~ 5 min per plate**

**1.** Prepare **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** multi-well plates at room temperature. For this protocol, 24-well plates are used as example.

**2.** Add fecal slurry to each well in a 1:1 volume ratio with **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel**.

Example: For a 24-well plate, add 700 &#956;L of fecal slurry as each well contains 700 &#956;L of **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel**.

Volumes for other plate formats:

 - 6-well: 3,700 &#956;L
 - 12-well: 1,600 &#956;L
 - 48-well: 350 &#956;L
 - 96-well: 100 &#956;L
 
**3.** Cover the plates and incubate at 37 &deg;C under aerobic or anaerobic conditions for up to 72 hours depending on experimental design.

::: {.callout-note}
## Note

The recommended incubation period is 72 hours but it may be adjusted as required by the user.

To test the effects of molecules (e.g. biotics, active principles) on microbiota, it is recommended to let microbiota stabilize in **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** for 24 hours at 37 &deg;C before adding the molecule of interest.

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Optional

The multi-well plates can be sealed with a breathable sealing membrane prior to incubation to prevent cross-contamination.

:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## CRITICAL

The fecal slurry should be added gently (to avoid cross-contamination) to the top of **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel**. Do not mix. 

While not a strict requirement, ensuring anaerobic conditions prior culturing in **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** will prevent the loss of obligate anaerobes.

:::


### C. Dissolution of **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel**  

{{< iconify svg-spinners:clock >}} **Timing: ~ 3 min per well**

**1.** For each well, remove the supernatant from the surface of **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** by gentle aspiration, without disturbing the gel.

  - Wash the gels by adding 700 &#956;L (for 24-well plates) of 0.9% NaCl solution.

  - Gently aspirate and discard the supernatant.

::: {.callout-note}
## Note

The washing step ensures that we only consider microbes colonizing **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel**.
:::

**2.** Add Bac<sup>3</sup>Gel&reg; dissolution medium (50 mM sodium citrate solution) to each well. Mix thoroughly to fully dissolve **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** structure. 

  - To calculate the volume of Bac<sup>3</sup>Gel&reg; dissolution medium to add to each well, enter the volume (&#956;L) of **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** according to the multi-well plate typology and click **Calculate**:

```{=html}
<input id="userInput" type="number" placeholder="Enter Gut3Gel volume (µL)">
<button onclick="calculate()" style="color: #c6dda4; font-weight: bold;">Calculate</button>


<p id="result"></p>

<script>
function calculate() {
  // get input value
  var x = parseFloat(document.getElementById("userInput").value);

  if (isNaN(x)) {
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "❌ Please enter a valid number.";
    return;
  }

  // formula
  var y = 1.5 * x;   

  // show result
  document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Add: " + y.toFixed(0) + " &#956;L";
}
</script>
```

  - Transfer the homogenized samples to microcentrifuge tubes.
  
::: {.callout-note}
## Note

Full dissolution of **Gut<span style="color:#97c879"><sup>3</sup></span>Gel** can take some time depending on the plate format and on the presence of exopolysaccharides. 

For sequencing: Centrifuge the samples (14,000 x g, 10 minutes), then use the pellet for DNA extraction.

For metabolomics: Centrifuge the samples (14,000 x g, 10 minutes), then collect and lyophilize the supernatant.

Other applications include assessing cell viability, performing flow cytometry analysis, measuring metabolic activity, and conducting standard microbiological characterization assays.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem 1**

The gels are not dissolving properly or take too long to dissolve.

**Potential solution**

*Solution 1:* Increase the volume of 50 mM sodium citrate and mix.
